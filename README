* How to build and use

ydiff is implemented in Scheme. The Scheme implementation I'm using is
Racket. You can find it from http://racket-lang.org.

ydiff supports multiple languages but currently it is not cleanly
modularized for different languages. There are global parameters,
which I should remove later.

There is no Unix command line interface. In order to use it, you need
to load the 'diff-<lang>.ss' files in the Racket repl before invoking
the diff-<lang> functions. For example:

(load "diff-scheme.ss")
(diff-<lang> "file1.ss" "file2.ss")
