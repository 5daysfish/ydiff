yDiff


* How to build and use

yDiff is implemented in Scheme. The Scheme implementation I'm using is Racket.
You can find it from http://racket-lang.org.

It supports multiple languages but currently it is not cleanly modularized for
different languages, and there is no Unix command line interface. In order to
use it, you need to load the 'diff-<lang>.ss' files in the Racket repl before
invoking the diff-<lang> functions. For example:


(load "diff-scheme.ss")
(diff-<lang> file1 file2)
